# Chrome Extension with Extra Features for [Equestria Daily](http://www.equestriadaily.com/)
This is a chrome extension made to give EQD some extra features like image browsing

### Currently has:
* Scrolling using arrows on DrawFriend
* Checkbox for showing Saucy Images
* Connects the Settings to the nav-bar
* Press ' or " to go to or back from comments
* Press ESC to stop typing comment
